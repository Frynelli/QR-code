## Overview
It was a nice basic practice of html/css to style a qr code.
It was helpful cause it kind of cleared a bit my thinking of containers and how the items in it behave with display and the margins etc.

## My process
I started by building the html page and then from top to bottom my styling. 
 I got confused with how the div container and the elements inside was behaving and learned a lot on how to use flex.
